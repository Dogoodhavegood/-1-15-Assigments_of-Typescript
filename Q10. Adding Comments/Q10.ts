// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, 
// and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific 
// to write because your programs are too simple at this point,
//  just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
//  Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
